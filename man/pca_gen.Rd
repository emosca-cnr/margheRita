\title{PCA
Function that allows to perform PCA. Graphs of Scree plot and pairs of the first 10 components were plotted. Score and loading plot, choosing pcx and pcy, were plotted launching function plot2DPCA after pca function.}
\usage{

  mRList,
  dirout,
  col_by = "class",
  scaling = c("none", "Pareto", "uv"),
  include_QC = TRUE,

\arguments{
\item{mRList}{mRList object}

\item{dirout}{output directory}

\item{col_by}{(default class)}

\item{scaling}{choose the scaling method "none","pareto" or "uv"}

\item{include_QC}{(default TRUE)}

\item{top}{only the top most varying features will be used}

\item{write_output}{(default =FALSE) if it turns on TRUE tables as .csv of score and loading will be saved}
